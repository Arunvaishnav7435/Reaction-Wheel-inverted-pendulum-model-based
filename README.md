# Reaction-Wheel-inverted-pendulum-model-based
An inverted pendulum is a device which actively keeps itself 180 degrees from the stable equilibrium point. The same control is used in keeping rockets pointed upward, to make humanoid robots stand up and balancing other things.
Reaction wheel inverted pendulum uses a reaction wheel attached to an actuator on the pendulum to provide counter torque against gravity.
This project does not technically used a wheel, but a auminium strip with screws at the end to increase its rotational inertia.
